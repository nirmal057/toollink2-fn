# Navigation Test Guide

## Fixed Issues:
1. **Z-index conflicts**: Added `relative z-50` to navigation bar to ensure it stays above other elements
2. **Background overlay interference**: Fixed Register and Login pages to use `min-h-[calc(100vh-4rem)]` instead of `min-h-screen` and added `-z-10` to background overlays
3. **Cursor pointer**: Added explicit `cursor-pointer` classes to all navigation links
4. **Layout positioning**: Ensured navigation bar doesn't get covered by page content

## Testing Steps:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/auth/register
2. Click on "Home" in the navigation bar - should navigate to http://localhost:5173/
3. Navigate back to http://localhost:5173/auth/register
4. Click on "Sign In" in the navigation bar - should navigate to http://localhost:5173/auth/login
5. Test that all navigation links show proper hover effects (emerald color changes)

## Expected Behavior:
- All navigation links should be clickable with visible cursor change
- Navigation should work smoothly without page refresh (React Router)
- Hover effects should show emerald/cyan colors consistently
- Icons should display properly with consistent sizing
