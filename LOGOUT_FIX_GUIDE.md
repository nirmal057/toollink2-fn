# Logout Functionality Test Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the testing procedure for the enhanced logout functionality in the ToolLink application.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Sidebar Logout Issues Fixed**
- ✅ **Formatting Issue**: Fixed malformed code in `handleLogout` function
- ✅ **State Management**: Improved `isLoggingOut` state handling to prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Fallback Logic**: Added proper fallback when `onLogout` prop is not available
- ✅ **Timeout Protection**: Added safe logout with timeout fallback

### 2. **App.tsx Logout Enhancement**
- ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed console logging for debugging
- ✅ **State Coordination**: Improved state management during logout
- ✅ **Safe Logout**: Implemented timeout-protected logout mechanism
- ✅ **Guaranteed Redirect**: Ensured redirect happens even if errors occur

### 3. **Header Logout Improvement**
- ✅ **Consistent Implementation**: Updated to use safe logout utility
- ✅ **Menu State Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of open menus before logout
- ✅ **Timeout Protection**: Added 3-second timeout fallback

### 4. **AuthService Enhancement**
- ✅ **Better Cookie Clearing**: Enhanced cookie clearing with domain-specific clearing
- ✅ **Async Delay**: Added small delay to ensure all operations complete
- ✅ **Improved Logging**: Better logging for debugging logout process

### 5. **New Logout Utilities**
- ✅ **Created `logoutUtils.ts`**: New utility file with helper functions
- ✅ **Force Logout Function**: Failsafe logout that always redirects
- ✅ **Safe Logout with Timeout**: Wrapper that adds timeout protection
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handles all edge cases

## Testing Procedure

### Test 1: Sidebar Logout
1. Log in to the application using credentials:
   - Email: `demo@toollink.com`
   - Password: `demo123`
2. Navigate to any page in the dashboard
3. Click the "Logout" button in the sidebar (bottom of sidebar)
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - After confirming, user is redirected to login page
   - All authentication data is cleared
   - No console errors

### Test 2: Header Logout (User Menu)
1. Log in to the application
2. Click on the user icon in the top-right header
3. Select "Sign Out" from the dropdown menu
4. **Expected Result**:
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - After confirming, user is redirected to login page
   - Dropdown menu closes properly
   - All authentication data is cleared

### Test 3: Logout Timeout Fallback
1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab and set throttling to "Slow 3G" or "Offline"
4. Click logout from either sidebar or header
5. **Expected Result**:
   - Even with network issues, logout should complete within 3 seconds
   - Fallback mechanism should trigger if needed
   - User is redirected to login page

### Test 4: Multiple Role Testing
Test logout functionality with different user roles:

**Admin User:**
- Email: `demo@toollink.com`, Password: `demo123`

**Warehouse Manager:**
- Email: `jane@example.com`, Password: `password123`

**Cashier:**
- Email: `mike@example.com`, Password: `password123`

**Customer:**
- Email: `customer@example.com`, Password: `password123`

### Test 5: Browser Session Cleanup
1. Log in to the application
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check Application/Storage tab for tokens in localStorage
4. Perform logout
5. **Expected Result**:
   - All localStorage items are cleared
   - All sessionStorage items are cleared
   - All cookies are cleared
   - No authentication data remains

## Console Logging
The enhanced logout system provides detailed console logging:

```
App handleLogout: Starting safe logout process...
AuthService logout: Starting logout process...
AuthService logout: All data cleared successfully
AuthService logout: Process completed
App handleLogout: State updated, redirecting...
```

## Error Handling
The system handles various error scenarios:
- Network timeouts (3-second fallback)
- AuthService failures (force logout fallback)
- State management conflicts (proper cleanup)
- Browser compatibility issues (multiple redirect methods)

## Browser Compatibility
Tested logout methods work across:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Success Criteria
✅ **Logout works from both Sidebar and Header**  
✅ **User is always redirected to login page**  
✅ **All authentication data is cleared**  
✅ **No console errors during logout**  
✅ **Timeout protection prevents hanging**  
✅ **Works across different user roles**  
✅ **Confirmation dialogs work properly**  
✅ **Menu states are cleaned up properly**  

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered, the changes can be reverted by:
1. Removing `src/utils/logoutUtils.ts`
2. Reverting the import statements in App.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, and Header.tsx
3. Restoring the original logout functions
4. The previous version's logout logic is preserved in git history
